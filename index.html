        Let me tell you a bit about myself.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am a twenty-ssshh year old learning how to code. I am a big ol' bookworm and dog lover. My current favourite
        book is called <em>The five people you meet in Heaven</em> and my current favourite dog is called <em>Zeus</em>.

        <h3>Travelling</h3>
        <p>
          Besides dogs and books, a really big passion of mine is <strong>travelling</strong>. This year I was fortunate
          enough to visit these countries:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tanzania</li>
          <li>Miami</li>
          <li>Philippines</li>
          <li>Jamaica</li>
          <li>Bahamas</li>
          <li>Los Angeles</li>
          <li>Albania</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          and in 2025 I hope to visit many more countries. You can keep up with my travels on a travel tiktok I started
          very recently: <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@haychabroad" target="_blank"> Haych Abroad</a>

        <h3>Fitness</h3>
        <p>
          I've always considered myself a fitness girly, Growing up I was enrolled in Ballet, Gymnastics, and Karate classes but never took them too seriously. As I entered adult life, fitness became extremely important to me and I became fascinated with gut health and physical activity. Some of the things I do now to keep fit and healthy include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gym 3x a week</li>
          <li>A 5k run Mon-Fri & walk my dog</li>
          <li>Try my best at clean eating</li>
          <li>An early bedtime</li>
          <li>Keeping hydrated</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="card-across">
        <h3>Reading</h3>
        <p>
          Like I said initally, I'm a big ol' bookworm. I love reading from a range of fiction and non-fiction genres (not
          so much horror) but I think theres a special place in my heart for Psychological/Philosophical and Romance
          Fiction. Books that touch on the interconnectedness of humans and the relationships we build often are the books
          I enjoy most. I think my top 5 favourite books that I've read this year are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Anxious People</li>
          <li>The five people you meet in Heaven</li>
          <li>Yellow Face</li>
          <li>Girl, Woman, Other</li>
          <li>All About Love</li>
        </ol>
